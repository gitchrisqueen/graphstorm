    Identifies communities within a graph using modularity optimization or other community detection algorithms.

    Parameters:
        graph (networkx.Graph): The graph on which to detect communities.
        algorithm (str): The algorithm to use, e.g., 'louvain', 'girvan-newman'. Default is 'louvain'.
        distributed (bool): Whether to run the detection in a distributed manner. Default is False.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary mapping community IDs to lists of node IDs.
