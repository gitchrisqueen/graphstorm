    Calculates the PageRank of nodes in a graph, optionally using distributed processing.

    Parameters:
        graph (networkx.Graph): The graph on which to compute PageRank.
        alpha (float): The damping factor (typically 0.85).
        distributed (bool): Whether to run the computation in a distributed manner. Default is False.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are node IDs and values are their PageRank scores.
