# GraphStorm Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the **GraphStorm** project, detailing the major milestones and features to be implemented. The roadmap is divided into phases, each with specific objectives and deliverables.

## Phase 1: Project Initialization

### Objectives:
- Set up the project structure and initial repository.
- Draft comprehensive documentation to guide development.
- Establish the core development environment.

### Deliverables:
- [x] Create GitHub repository with an initial project structure.
- [x] Draft `README.md` with project overview and usage instructions.
- [x] Create `requirements.txt` with necessary dependencies.
- [x] Set up the initial file structure for the project (`src/`, `docs/`, `examples/`).
- [x] Draft `ROADMAP.md` to outline the project development phases.

## Phase 2: Core Features Implementation

### Objectives:
- Implement the core graph algorithms for distributed processing.
- Ensure the project can run both locally and on a distributed cluster.

### Deliverables:
- [ ] Implement **PageRank** algorithm with both local and distributed execution.
- [ ] Implement **Community Detection** algorithm with both local and distributed execution.
- [ ] Implement **Graph Partitioning** and **Load Balancing** techniques.
- [ ] Develop a simple **distributed processing** setup using Dask and Ray.
- [ ] Document the usage of each algorithm in the `examples/` directory.

## Phase 3: Performance Optimization and Benchmarking

### Objectives:
- Optimize the implemented algorithms for distributed execution.
- Benchmark the performance of the project across various configurations.

### Deliverables:
- [ ] Optimize **PageRank** and **Community Detection** for distributed clusters.
- [ ] Implement performance optimizations for **Graph Partitioning**.
- [ ] Conduct performance benchmarks comparing single-node and distributed executions.
- [ ] Document the results in the `benchmarks/` directory.
- [ ] Provide detailed performance analysis in `performance_results.md`.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features and Extensions

### Objectives:
- Implement additional features and advanced graph analytics techniques.
- Explore potential extensions like integrating machine learning models.

### Deliverables:
- [ ] Explore the integration of **neural network-based graph algorithms**.
- [ ] Implement additional graph algorithms like **Shortest Path** or **Centrality** measures.
- [ ] Extend the distributed processing framework to handle more complex workflows.
- [ ] Update documentation to include new features and their usage.

## Phase 5: Finalization and Deployment

### Objectives:
- Finalize the project for public release.
- Prepare the project for deployment and wider usage.

### Deliverables:
- [ ] Finalize all documentation, including `design_decisions.md` and `api_documentation.md`.
- [ ] Create a deployment guide for running **GraphStorm** on various platforms.
- [ ] Conduct final testing and debugging.
- [ ] Promote the project through GitHub, social media, and relevant communities.
- [ ] Solicit feedback and iterate based on user input.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Ideas:
- Integration with cloud-based Kubernetes clusters for larger-scale deployments.
- Incorporation of real-time graph analytics with streaming data.
- Development of a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
